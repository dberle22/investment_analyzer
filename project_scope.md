# ðŸ“˜ Investment Research Tool â€“ Project Scope

## Summary

The **Investment Research Tool** is a modular, Python-based analytics project designed to identify and evaluate promising investment opportunities â€” starting with publicly traded stocks and ETFs. The tool supports data ingestion, performance benchmarking, fundamental and sector analysis, and research report generation. Future iterations will integrate LLMs (Large Language Models) to summarize and explain financial insights in natural language.

This project also serves as a platform to practice and document software engineering, data analytics, Git/GitHub workflows, and financial research methods.

## Goals

- Create a reusable framework for stock-level investment research
- Build modules for data ingestion, performance analysis, and reporting
- Integrate benchmark and sector comparisons
- Explore fundamentals and valuation techniques
- Generate research-ready reports (Markdown, PDF, HTML)
- (Future) Summarize insights using OpenAI/GPT or similar LLMs
